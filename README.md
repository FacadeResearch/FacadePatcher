# FacadePatcher
A simple utility to patch Facade's imports to automatically load FacadeModLoader.

# How To Use
  1. Build the project using Visual Studio (or however else you prefer)
  2. Run FacadePatcher.exe as an administrator.
  3. Make a backup of animEngineStarter.exe. Just in case anything goes wrong during the patching process.
  4. Select animEngineStarter.exe
  5. Close FacadePatcher.exe if it displays "Patched. You may now launch Facade."
  6. Don't forget to also place FacadeModLoader.dll in the game folder before running Facade or else it'll probably crash.
